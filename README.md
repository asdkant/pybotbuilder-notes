# Notes on botbuilder python library
I found MIcrosoft's BotBuilder python libraries profoundly underdocumented, and had to delve into the code to better understand how things work (also, microsoft's docs navigation is terrible). I wrote these notes for myself, don't expect anything fancy, but they may come in useful to other users of the libraries.
